    "# Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we will analyze data regarding employees that used to work for the [Department of Eduction, Training and Employment]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute, both in Queensland, Australia - but no longer do so. And aim to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction?\n",
    "* What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "* Is there a difference between DETE and TAFE?\n",
    "* Can we see a trend over the years?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, we'll work with exit surveys of employees of these institutes. You can find the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and for the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey). [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.). This data can be found [here](https://app.dataquest.io/m/348/guided-project%3A-clean-and-analyze-employee-exit-surveys/1/introduction). (A Dataquest account is required.)\n",
    "\n",
    "During this study we will combine the results for both surveys, and show the result of the two institutes combined. Be aware that, although both institutes used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see over the course of the study, significant data cleaning steps are required first prior to be able to answering our questions. \n"
