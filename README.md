# Clean and analyze employee exit surveys

In this study, we will analyze exit surveys of employees that used to work for the Department of Eduction, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute, both in Queensland, Australia - but no longer do so. 

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data analytics with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).
